# Visualizing data

In this chapter, we will use the following packages:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false

library(tidyverse)
library(wooldridge)

```

The importance of plotting your data cannot be understated. A good graph can reveal patterns in the data that guide model building or extreme observations that point to potential data problems. It is hard to build a model

```{r}
model_1 <- lm(wage ~ exper, data = wage1)
```

```{r}
rlang::f_lhs(model_1$call$formula)
```
