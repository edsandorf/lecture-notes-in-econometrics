    "text": "Preface\nThis book is a collection of lecture notes and resources for ECN201 Econometrics at the School of Economics and Business at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences.\nThe class assumes that you are familiar with R. If you are not familiar with R, you are strongly encouraged to get familiar before proceeding. Excellent resources include Grolemund (2014) and Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund (2023).\nThe book follows closely Wooldridge (2019) and (re-)uses many of the examples from that book. Lecture Notes in Econometrics is a teaching compendium and a free supplement to Wooldridge (2019).\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nGrolemund, Garrett. 2014.
