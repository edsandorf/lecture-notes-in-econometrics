# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book is a collection of lecture notes and resources for ECN201 Econometrics at the School of Economics and Business at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences.

The class assumes that you are familiar with R. If you are not familiar with R, you are strongly encouraged to get familiar before proceeding. Excellent resources include @grolemund2014hands and @wickham2023r.

The book follows closely @wooldridge2019 and (re-)uses many of the examples from that book. Lecture Notes in Econometrics is a teaching compendium and a free supplement to @wooldridge2019.
