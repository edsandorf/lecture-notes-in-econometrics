# Economic data

Different types of econometric models are needed for different types of economic data.

## Cross-sectional data

## Time-series data

## Panel data

# Heteroskedasticity {.unnumbered}

In this chapter, we will use the following packages:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false

library(tidyverse)
library(wooldridge)
library(lmtest)

```

We the constant variance assumption.

$$
\text{Var}(u_i|X)=\sigma^2
$$

Heteroskedasticity is a violation of the constant variance assumption and instead we have:

$$
\text{Var}(u_i|X)=\sigma^2_i
$$

## How to detect heteroskedasticity?

We can test for heteroskedasticity using the Breusch-Pagan test. The null hypothesis is that there is no heteroskedasticity. The alternative hypothesis is that there is heteroskedasticity.
